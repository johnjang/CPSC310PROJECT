==================

L2E's Kamikaze Mavericks


CPSC310 project called Parking Pal.

Made a web service using Google Web Toolkit (GWT) to show all the available parking lots within certain radius from current user's position. 
It will show all information such as price, distance, location on google maps and etc... 
Also integrated with Twitter API to post locations automatically if user chooses to park at that place.
